FACIAL RECOGNITION ATTENDANCE SYSTEM,"we worked on it using python and open CV using libraries such as d-lib, C-Make and face recognition etc. in PyCharm community. The data is stored as attendance format in Excel sheets. the main explanation of our internship revolves under SVM (support vector machines). it's basically a process of graphical identification of face through positive and negative gradients divided with a hyper plane. if the positive gradients dominate the negative gradients it depicts as a face. this can be done by grayscale or RGB we used RGB differentiation.

HOG: HOG, or Histogram of Oriented Gradients, is a feature descriptor that is often used to extract features from image data. It is widely used in computer vision tasks for object detection.

SVM: Support Vector Machine is a supervised classification algorithm where we draw a line between two different categories to differentiate between them. SVM is also known as the support vector network.

A. In every session, as soon as you run the program the camera starts automatically and starts detecting the face in the frame. If the face detected is registered in the database, the system recognizes the face and shows his/her name on the screen. If the face is not registered the program will quit automatically.

B.  Post Processing
After face recognition and detection, the program creates an entry in the .csv file and exports and name and time in which the face was detected and marks the attendance. The system does not allow overwriting of a single entry.

More than just the steps, Diaspo teachers offered their stories and secrets too so learners got the tips and tricks you cannot get in a cookbook.

We helped Diaspo to automate this entire process. Teachers would upload their class details (including the ingredients list and recipe), a Zoom link would be automatically scheduled and a class page would be created pending admin approval. Once the class was approved by the admin, learners could book in as a one-off class or a subscription (using Stripe). At the time of the class, email reminders were automated and the recipe would be sent immediately after.

We created a user dashboard so learners could alter their subscription, see classes they've joined and revisit the recipes.

Communicare Hub,"We built the Communicare Hub using Bubble with Google Authentication so that only people with an employee email address could gain access.  

About Communicare:

Communicare is the community mental health center serving the Northern Central counties of Mississippi, including Calhoun, Lafayette, Marshall, Panola, Tate, and Yalobusha.

The Problem:

Communicare has a large team spread across Mississippi. Aggregating employee resources such as Policies, Newsletters and Board Meeting Minutes has always presented them with a challenge. Google Drive was their main solution, but employees had a difficult time locating resources when required.

Our Solution:

The Communciare team reached out to Automatic to help build an employee portal that could house all of their resource documents and act as the foundation for future internal tools.

We built the Communicare Hub using Bubble with Google Authentication so that only people with an employee email address could gain access.

The Communicare Hub has two user types: Standard and Admin users. In the platform, users can browse, search, open and download resources like Company Policies, Newsletters, and Meeting Minutes. Employees also have the ability to view internal job postings and refer their connections to apply for a job.

Employee referrals are tracked and accessible to admin users, who work to reward employees that recruited new team members.

Admin user types have the additional capability to upload, edit or delete resources as needed.

Key Features:

MergeMed,"Merge Med is a two-sided marketplace platform that connects medical device engineers with companies hiring for projects. 

Talent can sign up, provide details about their experience level and hourly rates. Companies can post new projects and define their requirements for applicants.

The Merge Med team reviews each new project and curates a Short List of talent. This short list is then provide to the Company. They then can invite Talent to interviews or to work on the project.

During the lifecycle of a Company’s project, the Talent will log the hours they spent working on that project - limited by the max hours defined by the Company.

When logged hours are approved by the Company, their total payment plus the application fee are automatically calculated, charged and paid to the Talent.

While a project is active, the Company team and Talent can private message directly in the platform.

Notifications are sent to Users when important activity happens in the app requiring their attention. Each one is displayed in the app and sent to the user as an email alert.

Companies can invite Team Members to help manage their projects and interact with their hired Talent.

Merge Med Admins have access to the Admin Portal where they can manage the app’s basic information, approve new user applications and manage the onboarding and commission amounts for each Company or Talent.

Admins have the ability to control the exact onboarding process for both user types in the Admin Portal. They’re able to easily change questions, options for multi-select and more.",https://automatic.so/case-study?p=1664771175278x759888870155485200,v9rblHe2
BlockBeam,"BlockBeam's Action Based Learning platform elevates talent and helps employers recruit from top bootcamps.

The BlockBeam team hired Automatic to build a web3 education and hiring platform. The platform enables Bootcamps to host course content and manage their application pipeline. Once students have successfully completed a bootcamp, they’re granted access to a job board.

Bootcamps & Courses:

Bootcamp providers are able to submit their bootcamp along with the cohort dates and times. They are also able to host digital course content and make it available to their students.

Bootcamp admins can set the price per seat in each course. Scholarships are also available to students and approved by the admins. Payments are submitted through the platform and immediately paid out to the Bootcamp account, with the BlockBeam platform taking a small percentage of each payment.

Job Board:

Employers can post job opportunities directly on the platform. They’re guaranteed that only vetted talent will be able to apply to these jobs. We manage this vetting process by only allowing graduates of bootcamps to access the job board.

Results:

Currently, the BlockBeam platform has over 150 users and is quickly growing. We’re continuing to make improvements to the platform, such as integrating NFT certificates for completion of Bootcamps and NFT based access to specific features of the platform.",https://automatic.so/case-study?p=1664768761125x939185031496597500,bpHYCq7o
Trackify,"Trackify is a KPI Tracking tool for sales teams that enables insights into daily success of individual contributors. 

The founder of Closify reached out to Automatic to build a platform that solved a problem shared by many of the sales teams that used the Closify platform. This platform enables these sales teams to define specific KPI’s that their sales people are responsible for, and tracks each sales person’s success in hitting these targets.

Sales Team Admin:

Sales teams are the primary account holders and are responsible for defining the different teams of sales people along with specific KPIs / metrics that each sales team is responsible for hitting.

The sales team admin has can invite their sales people to each team to begin tracking this data and building reports.

Sales People:

Once invited by their sales team admin, a salesperson can login and update their daily report metrics in the app. This is a form with inputs for each KPI metric they’re responsible for meeting.

This data is aggregated and displayed in a reporting dashboard to their sales team admin as well as in Leaderboards to encourage friendly competition. 

Results:

We launched Trackify in July and it already has over 150 active users and is growing rapidly. We are continuously adding new features to the platform to make it easier for sales people to track their data and for sales team admins to be notified when their team isn’t on track to hit their targets.",https://automatic.so/case-study?p=1664770522464x307301378098462700,0feNHudj
Closify,"Closify is a two-sided marketplace style platform that connects Company Teams with vetted sales Closers and manages their relationship. 

How it works:

After a quick onboarding form, they schedule a demo call with the Closify Team. 

In-app and email notifications are used to keep users informed of important activity taking place in their account.

Teams have a powerful search page to help them find the perfect Closer for their business.

Once they’re ready to work together, the Team can and invite them to join and define their commission rate.

When a Closer joins a Team, they can track deals. The Closer commission and platform fee are calculated based on the deal amount.

Once a deal is marked “closed” by the Closer, it is sent to the Team for confirmation.

The Dashboard allows Team members and Closers to quickly see the status of their deals and pipeline.

We built a custom Zapier application so that Closers can automate their deal creation in the platform. 

We think Closify’s metrics sum up the final results better than we’ll be able to.

Teams & Closers register and apply for access to the platform

To ensure quality talent, admins can determine whether or not a new user gets accepted into the app.

When first setting up an account, users are required to connect their payment or payout information. 

With Stripe Connect, we’re able to automatically charge a Team their commission amount, pay it out to the Closer and even take a small platform fee.

After reviewing their profile information, they can request an interview to meet IRL.

Invitations are managed in a simple workflow making it easy for Closers to see the Team’s details, then accept or decline the offer.

The Team is immediately charged the calculated Closer commission amount + Closify app fee. Fully automated using Stripe Connect.

The Team’s library houses training material and other resources that will help the Closers on their team.

Closify Admins have access to the Admin Portal where they can manage the app’s basic information, approve new user applications and manage the onboarding and commission amounts for each Team or Closer.

Gumshoe,"Gumshoe is a TikTok campaign management platform that enables marketing companies to track the success of their TikTok Creator campaigns. The project was completed, but was never launched.

The Nowadays Media team came to us looking to build a platform that made it easier to track the success of their Creator campaigns on TikTok. Instead of simply building a platform for them, we formed an equity partnership with their team to build a scalable SaaS that solved their problem.

Campaign Tracking:

Agencies have the ability to create Campaigns that group Creators and Posts in an organized way. When creating a campaign, the user defines a few variables to be tracked:

Creators: Define a list of Creator’s TikTok Profiles to monitor during the campaign dates.

Keywords, Hashtags and Mentions: The platform actively monitors each creator’s profile for new posts that contain the keywords, hashtags or mentions defined in the campaign.

Dates: The campaign will run from a start date to and end date and monitor the creators and post metrics during this time.

Campaign Reporting: 

Each campaign, creator and post has a Report page. This dashboard displays the analysis of engagement over time, which creators are generating the most engagement and a breakdown of each post’s success.

These reports provide insights into data that is otherwise unavailable to agencies when they hire creators to run UGC or advertisement campaigns for products.

Results:

The Gumshoe platform is complete, but not yet launched as we work on marketing material and are forming partnerships with strategic agencies for early testing.",https://automatic.so/case-study?p=1664771025024x587720971766202400,hF6EeEHH

ExcelWeb,"SaaS with more than 1200 clients

Excelweb is an automation system for sending bulk messages on WhatsApp.

Excel was used to create the program's interface. As everyone already knows Excel, I believe that it is easier for the user to use since he already knows Excel.

With Excelweb it is possible to create up to 9 different messages and customize each one of these messages with the system's TAGs. For example, I can customize the message I'm sending by adding the name, age... Any information that the user adds in Excelweb is possible to customize the message.

In addition, it is still possible to add up to 3 files (any format) to send along with the message. If you choose to send a photo or video, you can add a caption along with the file.

On the Sending Chronology tab, the user can choose the order in which the messages will be sent.

The timer makes it possible to choose the time the system will wait between sending messages from one number to another.

To make the submissions, a JavaScript program was developed using the lib whatsappweb.js(https://wwebjs.dev/guide/ ). So that the user does not have access to the code, an .exe of the .js file was created and, whenever the customer clicks Send, the VBA code in Excel calls the .exe created.

If you want to test the application, you can download the free version from this link: https://geniosdoexcel.com/automacao-whatsapp-gratis/

It is important to note that it requires Windows 8 onwards, Office 2016 onwards and will only work on computers with Windows installed

To answer the most frequent questions, a kind of chatbot was programmed using VBA within ExcelWeb

Animal Sponsorship,"Today Ampara Animal has two caretakers where it takes care (food, maintaining adequate space for the jaguars, medicine, veterinary costs) of Brazilian jaguars.

A two-step web application was developed where anyone can sponsor a jaguar by donating a monthly amount that will help with costs.

The first page lists all the jaguars containing some information about each one of them and about the keeper where they live.

The second page is the donation checkout part. It is here where the person will choose the amount that will be donated and what the payment method will be. Here an image of the animal chosen to sponsor, is shown on the page to customize

In the same way that you can sponsor a jaguar, you can also sponsor a dog or cat. Below are the links to the pages to sponsor each one of them.

Sponsor a dog: https://checkout.amparanimal.org.br/quero-apadrinhar-um-cao

Ampara Animal Website,"Institutional website created for the NGO Ampara Animal to bring all the information.

Here the idea is to bring all the information about the NGO, all the projects and partnerships with the brand. Show the different ways you can help the institution.

The site had already been created in another site builder by another company, but there was a need to migrate for some reasons:
- Value: Today the site is hosted by Hostgator and was completely recreated using the Elementor PRO plugin. Colonized on the scale there was a saving of 70% per year.
- Ease of modification: The Elementor plugin makes it possible to create/edit new pages in a very simple way. As there was no programmer at the NGO, an easy-to-use platform was needed.
- Performance: The old site was very heavy and did not perform well. Worpress has several easy-to-use plugins that can perform various optimizations on the site to make it more fluid, for example, convert all images to webp.

After recreating the page using Elementor, the Hostgator DNS editor was used to point the DNS to the Hostgator server",https://www.amparanimal.org.br/,7yRObaVp
My Wedding Website,"I'm getting married in 2023 and we needed a website to put all the information.

There are several platforms that offer ready-made templates (very limited and without much customization options) on the internet, but they are expensive and charge a very large fee for each banking operation when someone buys a wedding gift on the website.

As a good developer, I decided to create my own website, the way we wanted, using only bubble.io.

The idea was to develop a onepage web application containing wedding information such as:
- Counter for the event
- Place/time/how to get there
- Gifts list
- Confirmation of attendance

A docking top menu has been added so that the person can navigate the application more easily.

In the presence confirmation part, some personal data is requested and, as soon as the person clicks the button to confirm presence, the data is added to the database and a message is sent directly to the person's WhatsApp.

On the gifts part, we decided that we didn't want the physical gifts, so we brought the idea where people will give the money to give gifts. In order to make the gift tangible, we chose some items that represent us and people can give the gift as if they were buying a physical product.

I wanted to bring to the site the same idea of ​​an e-commerce where the person can add items to the cart and, when completing the purchase, move on to the payment part. That way, the person can easily give more than one gift by adding it to the cart.

The application has a floating page that summarizes the shopping cart with the item, quantity and total value.

An additional payment page (payment checkout) was created. Here the person will enter personal data, choose the payment method (ticket, pix or credit card). If you choose to pay by credit card, you will have the option to pay in up to 12 installments.

When the purchase is completed, a direct message is sent to the person's WhatsApp (via the number added on the payment page) thanking the person for the gift.

To carry out the banking transactions, the API of the companies ASAAS (https://asaasv3.docs.apiary.io/#reference) was used, which was added to the project through the API Connector plugin.

To send messages on WhatsApp, I use the Z-API (https://developer.z-api.io/)",https://casamentonoceu.bubbleapps.io/version-test,JY4VDUGn
Payment checkout for donation,"Create a custom Donation Payment Checkout.

The idea was to develop an application with the visual identity of the NGO Ampara Animal where the person could choose the payment method (credit card, pix or bill) and, in addition, had the option to choose the donation amount.

Two important points were added. The first one (in the first checkbox of the second page) the user can choose if he wants to make a one-time donation or if he wants to make this donation a recurring donation. The second checkbox invites the user to add the amount of fees, thus helping the NGO not to pay the platform fees.

As you can see in the attached image (page 2) some values ​​are already proposed. However, if the person wants to donate another amount, just click on the ""Outro Valor"" button and choose the desired amount.

Finally, in the last step, I present a summary of the transaction that will be carried out.

To carry out the banking transactions, the API of the companies ASAAS (https://asaasv3.docs.apiary.io/#reference) was used, which was added to the project through the API Connector plugin. In addition, Webhooks are used to update the payment status.

The application is connected with Google Data Studio, passing the database information to Google Sheets spreadsheets. The idea was to create a dashboard to analyze KPIs and bring insights to the NGO.

The app is connected to Mautic which is the email marketing platform I implemented. To send the emails, I used SMTP from ElasticEmail.

These integrations were done using Make (Integromat).",https://checkout.amparanimal.org.br/checkout_pantanal,lZamKmxZ

Enhancing Community Engagement and Sales through a Redesigned Website,"Background:
Datacapt is a community-based platform that offers services and resources on a wide range of topics. While they were able to attract traffic to their website, they struggled with converting those visitors into paying customers. They sought our services to help redesign their website to increase customer engagement and sales.


Goals:
•	Redesign the website to improve user experience, navigation, and overall aesthetics
•	Implement e-commerce best practices to facilitate sales and increase conversion rates
•	Create a platform that encourages community engagement and fosters loyalty among customers


Challenges:
•	The website lacked a clear, concise message about what Datacapt offers and the value it provides to customers
•	The previous website design was cluttered, difficult to navigate, and lacked a professional appearance
•	There were no clear calls-to-action for customers to purchase products or engage with the community
•	The platform lacked an efficient system for customer support and feedback


Solution:
To address these challenges, we approached the redesign of the Datacapt website with a focus on user experience, ease of navigation, and a clear messaging strategy. We followed these steps:
1.	Analyzed the previous website design and content to understand what worked and what did not
2.	Conducted user research to identify customer pain points, preferences, and expectations
3.	Developed a comprehensive content strategy that emphasizes the unique value proposition of Datacapt's services and resources
4.	Designed an intuitive and user-friendly website that aligns with e-commerce best practices, including clear product descriptions, pricing, and calls-to-action
5.	Created a customer support and feedback system that makes it easy for customers to get assistance and provide feedback
6.	Implemented tools to track and analyze user behavior, sales data, and customer feedback to continuously improve the platform


Results:
The new website design and improved user experience have helped Datacapt to achieve the following results:
1.	Increase in conversion rates from website visitors to paying customers
2.	Improvement in customer engagement and loyalty through the implementation of a user-friendly platform
3.	Reduction in customer support response time and increase in customer satisfaction
4.	Increase in sales and revenue due to the implementation of e-commerce best practices and a clear messaging strategy


Conclusion:
The Datacapt case study highlights the importance of a user-friendly website design and e-commerce best practices for increasing customer engagement, loyalty, and sales. By creating a comprehensive content strategy, designing an intuitive website, and implementing an efficient customer support system, we were able to help Datacapt improve its online presence and achieve its goals.",https://comunidade.semcodar.com.br,tuzMNEkz

As a developer for a SaaS startup, I helped develop an MVP of an online platform that offers a meditation and mood tracker app. The app was designed to help people find their inner peace through the practice of meditation, and it included a range of features to support users in their daily practice. The app had a user-friendly interface, and it was regularly updated with new content to keep users engaged.

Objectives:
The primary goal of the app was to provide users with a tool to help them manage their mood and emotions through meditation. The app was designed to be easy to use and accessible to people of all skill levels. The app was also designed to be cross-platform, meaning that it could be used on both mobile and web devices.

Challenges:
One of the challenges of developing the app was designing a user-friendly interface that would be easy for people to use. This involved testing and iterating on different designs and layouts to find the optimal solution. Another challenge was integrating Stripe and meta-masking for NFT wallet, which required working with third-party APIs to ensure that the app was secure and reliable.

Solution:
To overcome the challenges, I worked closely with the development team to ensure that the app was designed with a user-friendly interface. This involved conducting user research to understand the needs and preferences of our target audience. We also tested the app with real users to get feedback and make improvements.

To integrate Stripe and meta-masking for NFT wallet, we worked with third-party developers to ensure that the app was secure and reliable. We also conducted extensive testing to ensure that the app was functioning as expected.

Covid 19 Predictive analysis of Severity Illness,"Descriptive and Diagnostic analysis is done to identify hidden insights from data; Predictive analysis is done to predict severity illness determination from machine learning algorithm and prescriptive analysis is done to show how this machine learning algorithm going to help identifying severity illness.

This dataset is imbalanced and has a lot of missing values. As we know working with missing value is challenging and that's why data cleaning and feature engineering is one of the core part of this project. I did the coding and Data Analysis in Python. PostgreSQL/Sql is used to clean in some part of the project.

This is a classification problem and I selected Gradient Boosting Classifiers model for predicting severity illness. Gradient boosting classifiers are a group of machine learning algorithms that combine many weak learning models together to create a strong predictive model. Decision trees are usually used when doing gradient boosting. Gradient boosting models are becoming popular because of their effectiveness at classifying complex datasets.

To handle imbalanced data BorderlineSMOTE was used. I over sampled the minority class by BorderlineSMOTE and then again trained the model to see how it performs. Difference between severity illness prediction with imbalanced data and balanced data results were compared .

For prescriptive analysis LIME(Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) was used to explain the model’s result. Prescriptive model describes how this model can be applied in the real life scenario.",https://github.com/sadnanMohosin/Covid-19-Predictive-analysis-of-Severity-Illness,0n0LHIkG

Sanwo UI/UX Design,"The problems that come with buying online, among other factors, are payment and end mile delivery. But at the root of this problem is the issue of trust. 

Today’s e-commerce space has gone beyond the known brands like Jumia, Konga, Ali Express, etc. Individuals are now setting up stores online using several channels. Notable of these channels are the various social media at their disposal.

In a bid to curtail that, buyers demand payment on delivery, which result to decline in sales for noteworthy sellers who need upfront payment before goods are delivered.

I managed the site since the redesign and added a few projects to the site, for example, one of them is this Encyclopedia page, which soon started to perform very well according to the number of visits.

Retail agencies provisioning management,"Problem: The client, a retail company, uses SAGE X3 as an ERP, which did not include the management of retail agencies provisioning.

Development of Power BI reports and dashboards to display the performance of these processes from on-time delivery to cost-benefit analysis.",https://apps.powerapps.com/play/e/62ac0c06-9ebc-4742-b7d3-b27a0135acf1/a/5384e868-3c36-4477-a3f7-92a6370cfe0c?tenantId=0bd88cb1-d4a0-41e7-a207-b3a45e43aa5e&source=portal,DzkKaBr3
Equipment Transfer management,"Problem: The client used Excel along with pen and paper to manage the equipment transfer from their warehouse to the customer’s warehouse and vice versa. The risk of data loss was extremely high when using paper, Excel also presented security issues as users had the same access and view to the table.
Solution: Development of a model-driven app to replace Excel, pen and paper with a Word report which is created automatically with the use of Power Automate at the end of each transfer. This report contains the details of the transfer which a supervisor signs off on to conclude the process. Development of Excel dashboard and reports to provide visibility on activities.
This change significantly improved data security, automated processes, etc. The app also included more processes such as inventory management, sales, purchase, and transport.

Decoder Ring,"The Decoder Ring
https://emmapickard.github.io/decoder-ring-project/
A fun and interactive decoder ring! Bask in the nostalgia of encoding and decoding messages and secrets!
Decoder ring

if you're like me, you probably are wondering what a decoder ring even is! Back in the day, (no offense to those of more tenure) kids would rush to cereal boxes to obtain a plastic ring inside that helped them decode secret messages located on the box! I have essentially taken the fun and magic of decoding messages, and wrote JavaScript to allow you to encode and decode messages of your own, using 3 unique methods!

The Caesar Shift
Caesar Shift The Caesar shift is a type of substitution cipher originally used by Julius Caesar to protect messages of military significance. It relies on taking the alphabet and ""shifting"" letters to the right or left, based on the typical alphabetic order. For example, if you were to ""shift"" the alphabet to the right by 3, the letter A would become D.

The Polybius Square Cipher
Polybius Square Cipher

The Polybius square is a cipher that is achieved by arranging a typical alphabet into a grid. Each letter is represented through a coordinate. For example, in the above table, the letter B would be represented by the numerical pair 21.

The Substitution Cipher
Substitution Cipher

The substitution cipher requires a standard alphabet and a substitution alphabet. Letters from the standard alphabet will be transposed to the standard alphabet. This cipher requires that the recipient have the substitution alphabet, otherwise it will be difficult for them to decode the message.

Header

A 2022 ShellHacks Project aiming to create parent-teacher communities with equity.
Hello! We are a team of three! We are Emma, Jose, and Faisal! When we first set off on this project, we wanted to focus on something that is actually affecting people today to see if we could put something together that could alleviate that pain point. We landed on parents and their access to their students school life.

Parent Connect is a school hub application for parents to use in order to participate in their children's education. As a parent, one of the biggest priorities you have is your child. Their health, wellbeing and success is at the forefront of everything you do. Unfortunately, parents can't be super heroes 24/7. Some parents work multiple jobs to support their children, and as a result, may not have the luxury of connecting with teachers, attending PTA meetings, having a say in what their kid's school experience is like. Parent Connect was created with these parents in mind. They give everything they have, it's time we gave back.

Inspiration
Growing up, we experienced struggles with our parents being involved in our academic careers from an early age. Often times activities such as field trips, science-fair projects, PTA meetings and school activities were overlooked by parents who were just too busy with work and life. We recognized from a young age that our parents may have not had the luxury, or the literacy, or the availability, to make an impact on our education. We often wished for ways to get our parents to be be involved, we also knew our parents wished they could be there for us. From this came an idea; a way for parents to be able to make sure we have forms filled, ways for parents to connect with teachers and other parents, ways for them to be there for us in even more ways; a way for parents to connect.

What it does
Parent Connect is the hub for parents to access in order to participate in the academic lives of their children. From filling out forms, to noting important dates, to reviewing grades, submitting important forms, connecting with teachers and other parents alike, even having a list of important resources to empower them to be the best parents they can be! Parent Connect is one place to do many things to help you be the best parent. A full breakdown of features will be listed below.

How we built it
using VSCode Live Share and GitHub, we collaborated on this project together, working on individual components and then bringing them together. We used technology such as React.js, JSX, JavaScript ES6, HTML5, Node.js, Bootstrap and Vercel in order to write and execute the code, bring it all together, and then deploy it as a functional, standalone app.

Challenges we ran into
Our ambitions were huge. Far too huge. We are relatively new in our coding journeys, only having a few months worth of experience. This, combined with our limited time, meant we had to come back to the drawing board many times. We wanted so much for Parent Connect. We wanted to implement so much and showcase so many features, but one of the biggest challenges we faced was deciding what we wanted to showcase the most. We felt with our experience and with the time we had, it would be best to present a demonstration, a mock-up of the power and influence an app like Parent Connect could bring.

We ran into some hiccups with making sure we returned JSX elements for our React.js app. Sometimes it's easy to confuse JavaScript, HTML and JSX, which resulted in our app breaking more times than we'd probably like to admit. Overall though we managed to pull through using our collective knowledge and skillsets (and lots and lots of caffeine).

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Faisal is most proud of the poste create component, the form submission and the implementation of React Router. When we first started with this idea, we struggled with where to begin, so Faisal decided to start by building out our basic switch/route system. Once that was built, we snowballed into production, coming up with more routes, more components and more features to add. It was almost overwhelming how motivated we were!! As we continued, Faisal decided to implement forms we could submit, in the form of a field-trip permission slip. Finally, when we originally came up with the idea to have a parent forum, the idea was to initially just have a few parent posts displayed. It was only after doing so that Faisal felt it was missing something, so he went on to create a form and function to allow the user to create posts that would display!

Jose was proud of our data implementation. He singlehandedly wrote out our database files, troubleshooted them, and then connected them to active components on the page. His ability to brainstorm a solution to our disadvantages was impressive. Jose also was proud of using advanced JS features like array methods, ternary operators and bootstrap elements to elevate our code and how it looks on the page. Using these advanced JS features allows for our code to be applied in creative ways, stay DRY, and makes it friendly to read, from beginners to experts.

Emma was incredibly proud of the google translate API implementation. Using other technology shows initiative, collaboration and creativity. Her approach to solving a universal problem such as language barriers was extremely impressive. Emma also was extremely proud of breathing life into the project. If Jose and Faisal wove the book together, Emma definitely helped put words on the pages in the form of a comprehensive about page that speaks to the goals of our project, utiziling creative bootstrap elements to bring components together in the form of a NavBar, and rewriting components through and through until she got them just right. her attention to detail was a breath of fresh air that helped motiate us til the very end.

What we learned
We were very happy to learn, above all, that we CAN do this! We struggled with getting our feet off the ground but once we did, we started applying better concepts to help elevate our code, like single-responsibility components, DRY code, and implementing advanced/modern features! We learned that 2 (or 3) heads are way better than one. All alone, we definitely may have struggled with building an app like this, but together, we really bounced off each other and kept excellent momentum. We learned (the hard way) that sometimes, lack of experience and time constraints force us to take detours, revisit the drawing board and rethink our approach, and that's okay! We managed to find solutions to our problems that were within our means and we managed to create a project that fit our standards as beginner coders. We couldn't be happier with how things turned out.

What's next for parent connect?
We want to build more components that allow parents to connect directly with teachers on a 1x1 level. We hope to build out a message system and user functionality so that parents can create accounts and customize aspects of their user experience. We hope to even one day have enough components to where users can make changes to their dashboard, showing what's important to them at the very top and then giving them the option to search for other components. The sky is the limit!

Features
- Interactive Dashboard
Dashboard

Interactive components greet you on your personalized homepage. Here you will find information regarding your student and their teacher, announcements, upcoming events, grades, and even a poll! The announcements and poll components are interactable, allowing you to click or tap to vote for options, reach important forms, and view other pages.

Interactive Components

The upcoming events calendar allows you to schedule additonal events, such as parent-teacher confrences, tutorial sessions and more! Grades are color-coded and easily available to view, so that you can monitor your student's progress at a glance!

Interactive Components

- Embedded page translation using Google's API!
Translation

We recognize the overlap between parents who may often work hard and can't devote as much time to their student's academic participation, and parents who may have english as a second language. As a contributer with ESL parents, often times my parents didn't participate as often due to the intimidation of not having perfect english. Tools like this allow us to connect in ways that make us all feel equal.

Below is a list of tools and concepts used to help implement this webpage
Single-responsibility principle
A principle that states that each module, function, or component in a program should have responsibility for one single part of the program.

Frontend Routing via React Router
React Router is the de facto library for keeping React UI in sync with the URL. It has a simple API with powerful features. When you're building your app in React, React Router can help you make the URL your first thought, rather than an afterthought. As the visitor navigates around the site, they expect the URL to change along with the content on the page. Frontend navigation offers many benefits:

It allows visitors to bookmark pages.

It allows visitors to share links to specific content and pages.

It allows visitors to move forward and backward in their browsing history.

Routing between views is generally faster than backend routing.

Smooth transitions and animations between views are easier to implement.

Breaking up your code by page helps promote modularity.

The <Route> component may be the most important component in React Router. Its responsibility is to render some UI when its path matches the current URL. Wrapping a component with <Route> is similar to wrapping it in an if statement. If the URL matches the path property of the route, the component will be rendered.

Programmatic navigation
It is common for a web application to automatically go to a different page in response to the visitor's actions. Most often, navigation is triggered by the user clicking a link. Yet, in some situations, the application needs to create, update, or delete some data before navigating to the new page. This can be implemented using programmatic navigation, which is navigation that causes a user to be redirected as a result of an event—such as logging in or saving—that occurs on a route

Nested Routes
Sometimes, as the visitor navigates through the site, you want to change only a small part of the screen, not the entire page. The solution is to use nested routes to display more than one component at the same time. Nested routes, or child routes, are routes displayed inside of another route. This means that there can be more routes inside a component that is rendered by another route.",https://parent-connect.vercel.app/,Pqu5zLrM

Pinterest needs a slight upgrade in terms of UI and making certain elements cohesive and consistent and subtle animations can give a huge uplift to the overall look and feel of the app and the kind of emotion the user of the app feels after a certain interaction with the app takes place. I have tried to remain within the boundaries of the current design and colour scheme of the app, and have avoided anything that would make the app look completely different from how it already is. I have tried to restrict myself in their design language and make the adjustments needed at certain places.",https://rudradas.design/making-pinterest-more-inspirational.html,BNKOJtzB

Lakbay - Your Jeepney Tracking Alalay,"To begin, we must assure accessibility by developing an app that would track jeepneys.
Following that, having a tracking application will assure safety, and having an online payment function will aid to reduce the inconvenience for both the passenger and the driver.

That is why we came up with the Software Application named Lakbay! To put it simply, Lakbay is a two-way mobile tracking application for jeepney drivers and commuters. that attained UN-SDG 9 and 11, developing an application that aims to provide access to safe, affordable, and sustainable transport systems for all.

How it works?
- Search for routes
- Check the details of the jeepney then;
- LAKBAY (off to go)


Lakbay has a feature where you can see the availability and details of the jeepneys and the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA). Jeepney drivers will be also able to know the location of the passenger.

Our application differs from our competitors from focusing primarily on the most commonly used public transit; jeepney. Lakbay is undoubtedly a user-friendly application. It is also innovative because no other application for tracking jeepneys has yet been developed and is affordable and accessible at anytime, anywhere.",https://www.figma.com/proto/a71uwKEpbYmhosD64nrAng/Lakbay---Your-Jeepney-Booking-Alalay?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=221%3A137&viewport=5081%2C11357%2C0.49&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=221%3A507,4ej4W4gD

HOL Kenya ,"Niche: E-commerce 

This was a redesign/revamp gig plus digital marketing consultancy and eventually leading to training to have an in-house abled digital team to run the website from the inside. 

HOL(House of Linen) were coming from a point where they had conflict in the value proposition of their linen products and their web presence. The web design was wanting as well as their social media presence and SERP dominance. 

Hence the problem statement had 3 major tasks;
* Web Redesign 
* Digital Marketing 
* Search engine Optimization

Web Redesign 
I redesigned the website as a whole by factoring uniform color grading and ambience to represent their theme to the core. 

The menu also sorted the page hierarchy issues for proper sitemap indexing. 

Image qualify and size was an issue by making sure as much the client wanted high quality resolution images they had to be optimized for page speeds. 

Digital Marketing 
The client has very vibrant social media presence as well with a defined buyer persona. At the time of contracting, the ad spend was average while coupled with low to almost no return on investment. 

I helped outline a proper digital marketing plan that would handle Google Ads, FB/IG Ads. Linkedin Ads and introduced the brand on Pinterest for organic traffic sourcing. 

SEO
Traffic on the website was mostly paid traffic and from a SEO point that's a red flag. Proper on-page SEO was needed. With the help on the sales and marketing team we identified what clients ask for when they come to the shop or call. We also looked into the enquiries and what the question statements were like and from the we had our bubble-moment with keywords. We also used other keyword research tools such as Ubersuggest and Keyword everywhere extension. 

We pieced content pieces together such as product descriptions. Image SEO was also key hence we defined alt text for most of the images. 

Finally, the website was up and running and has since become a top ranking platform especially in the interior decor, premium linen and fabric sector.",https://houseoflinen.co.ke,KjQEZ4l3

Sentiment Analysis,"Objective The objective of this project is to extract textual data articles from the given URL and perform text analysis to compute variables that are explained below.

Data Extraction For each of the articles, given in the links.xlsx file, the article text is extracted and saved in a text file with URL_ID as its file name.

Data Analysis For each of the extracted texts from the article, textual analysis is performed and variables are computed. The output is saved in “result.csv”

Text Analysis Sentimental Analysis Sentimental analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative, or neutral. It consists of steps:

Cleaning using Stop Words Lists The Stop Words Lists (found in the folder words) are used to clean the text so that Sentiment Analysis can be performed by excluding the words found in Stop Words List.

Creating a dictionary of Positive and Negative words The Dictionary (found in the folder words) is used for creating a dictionary of Positive and Negative words. We add only those words in the dictionary if they are not found in the Stop Words Lists.

Extracting Derived variables Positive Score: This score is calculated by assigning the value of +1 for each word if found in the Positive Dictionary and then adding up all the values. Negative Score: This score is calculated by assigning the value of +1 for each word if found in the Negative Dictionary and then adding up all the values. Polarity Score: This is the score that determines if a given text is positive or negative in nature. It is calculated by using the formula: Polarity Score = (Positive Score – Negative Score)/ ((Positive Score + Negative Score) + 0.000001) Range is from -1 to +1

Word Count We count the total cleaned words present in the text by removing the stop words.",https://github.com/mondoljohn/sentiment-analysis,2q7eV8eX

Lancaster Archery Shopify Website Re-design,"Lancaster Archery Supply is a leading worldwide archery retailer and wholesaler that offers the largest selection in archery equipment, as well as technical expertise. I served as the Senior UX/UI Designer for this project.

Challenges
Lancaster Archery Supply needed to modernize its eCommerce site to increase speed and performance, improve product findability and overall shopping experience, and build a strong foundation for future enhancements. Out-of-the-box solutions couldn’t accommodate Lancaster Archery’s extensive and technically complex catalog with varying data structure requirements. The company turned to eHouse Studio to develop a customized Shopify Plus site for D2C and B2B, as well as other customizations needed to bring it all together. 

Solution
eHouse Studio applied its deep expertise in IA and UX/UI to design an intuitive shopping experience for technical products and accessories. In addition, eHouse migrated the sites from Magento to Shopify Plus, giving Lancaster Archery Supply more control, flexibility, and scalability. This improved the experience both for customers and for the marketing and merchandising teams that would be able to easily update marketing and product content without needing a developer. 

Information architecture redesign
Most of Lancaster’s customers are extremely knowledgeable about archery products and accessories. When redesigning the site’s information architecture (IA), eHouse Studio avoided making assumptions about what customers did and didn’t know and how they shopped. We did a lot of listening and incorporated what we heard from the client, as well as findings from competitive research. We then applied our expertise to translate this information into an effective navigation experience.  

Guided shopping experiences
To keep customers from feeling overwhelmed by Lancaster Archery Supply’s extensive product catalog, we implemented a cascading menu to take customers through decisions one step at a time. Customers browse first by category and then subcategory, allowing them to easily and intuitively narrow the scope of their selection versus navigating the full menu (For example: Bows > Compound Bows > Target Compound Bows). 

We designed the navigation menu to allow for marketing messages and product photos to showcase new products and enhance understanding of what types of products could be found in each category. 

In addition, we designed top-level product landing pages to function similarly, showcasing subcategories with product imagery for easier product findability. 

Overall, we focused on making technical information clear to help customers quickly find what they want and ensure compatibility with other products. 

Solution for Shopify’s variant limit 
Lancaster Archery Supply’s catalog included a handful of products that exceeded Shopify’s 100 variant and three variant group limit. To address this, eHouse Studio created a Shopify-native solution that was fully integrated with the ERP and synched inventory tracking. The solution enabled Lancaster to add and manage as many new products and variants (e.g., more complex product structures including variants exceeding the limit, bundles, customizable products, and custom add-ons) as needed.

Smart on-site search optimization  
Robust on-site search was critical for increasing conversions of Lancaster Archery Supply’s highly knowledgeable customers. To help customers find products faster, eHouse Studio integrated Searchspring to enable smart recommendations in the search bar – including suggested terms and product images – that appear as the user types. 

Integrating Searchspring also gave the Lancaster team more granular control over merchandising, allowing them to customize their collection pages with rules-based controls to feature products in a specific order.

In addition, we ensured that search results pages could be easily filtered by various specifications as well as auto-suggest search suggestions to help customers more quickly zero in on what they want.

Tiered pricing functionality
Lancaster Archery Supply offers tiered pricing levels for both D2C and B2B customers. To personalize the shopping experience on both the D2C and B2B eCommerce sites (i.e., automatically show tier-specific discounted pricing), eHouse Studio customized the logged-in experience and worked closely with our partners at Searchspring to ensure pricing consistency across all product detail pages and collection pages.

Super-charged gift-with-purchase 
Lancaster Archery Supply wanted ultimate flexibility when it came to gift-with-purchase (GWP) promotions, so eHouse Studio implemented a robust GWP system to enable Lancaster to run any GWP promotion under the sun – without needing a developer. 

Flexible product bundling
Lancaster Archery Supply has many products that are distinct SKUs but are always sold together (e.g., a scope and a lens). To accommodate this complexity on the fulfillment side while making the front-end experience seamless for the customer, eHouse Studio integrated a third-party app to enable bundling of any combination of products. 

Results
The new site was game-changing for Lancaster Archery Supply’s online business, with significant increases in site speed and average order value (AOV) and a huge drop off in bounce rates. In addition, the company was able to shift its focus (and budget) from maintenance of performance issues to planning site enhancements to support its business strategy.

• 7% increase in AOV overall
• 10% increase in AOV on mobile
• 7% increase in mobile revenue
• 39% improvement in page load times
• 30% overall improvement on page bounce rate",https://lancasterarchery.com/,0MN2QB5R

NoBull Athlete Website Design,"NoBull is a footwear, apparel, and accessory retail brand. I served as the lead User Experience and Interface Designer for the NoBull TV website.

NoBull leadership wanted a website that was separate from the e-commerce experience that showcased the professional athletes associated with the NoBull brand. Originally, the NoBull professional athlete content lived on the e-commerce website however due to CMS constraints, the content was unorganized which resulted in a poor user experience and minimal engagement. Leadership’s solution was to move the NoBull professional athlete content from the e-commerce website to its own domain where a team could properly organize and manage it and users could easily navigate and engage with it.

My research started with stakeholder interviews and competitive landscaping. The result of the research outlined all of the direct and indirect competitors and helped narrow the design direction.

Even though most of the design elements were lifted from the e-commerce website, I made a style tile for the developers to reference that included an annotated summary of the foundational elements like the typography, color palette, and iconography in addition to all of the primary components and patterns like buttons and content layout. 

I designed a low-fidelity version of the website and prototyped the video reel horizontal scroll animation. Once everything was presented and approved by the NoBull team I designed the high-fidelity version of the website and assisted the development team in seeing it through to production.",https://studiosewell.com/work/nobull/,R8yyKDU8
Hapibrain iOS and Android Mobile App Design,"Hapibrain is a mobile app that helps you develop habits that lead to better mental health. I served as the lead and sole User Experience and Interface Designer for Hapibrain.

Their original mobile app was extremely underwhelming and was only rated one star on the app store. In an effort to better understand their space and their product, I led a workshop with Dr. Daniel Amen, the owner of the product, along with several other key stakeholders involved with the company. We performed some ideation exercises like crazy eights and postup.

After the workshop, I spent a week creating a product roadmap deck. The intention of this deck was to align on what we were building, who we were building it for, and how we were going to approach the experience. This foundational piece of the process helped guide the design and development stages of the project.

Once the deck was presented, reviewed, and approved, I started wireframing the experience for some of the key features of the app. I also started designing foundational pieces of the design system like typography, the color palette, animation patterns, and design element styles like buttons and iconography.

Once the low-fidelity version of the app was designed, presented to stakeholders, iterated on, and eventually approved by the Habibrain team, I designed the high-fidelity version of the app. I worked directly with developers during the app’s development.",https://studiosewell.com/hapibrain/,Luuorr0z
Grace Hypnosis and Meditation iOS Mobile App Design,"Grace Hypnosis and Meditation is a mobile app that provides relaxing audio sessions that hope to curve anxiety, stress, and other mental health issues that people struggle with on a daily basis. I served as the lead and sole User Experience and Interface Designer for Grace Hypnosis.

Their original mobile application aesthetic looked dated, the interface was slow and laggy, and the overall experience was uninviting and confusing. This resulted in negative VOC feedback and a lack of engagement. The challenge of this project was re-branding something in a saturated space that was regarded as an uncompetitive product when compared to apps like Calm and Headspace. Fortunately, the owners of the Grace Hypnosis app were willing to start from scratch. They re-recorded all of their hypnosis and meditation audios in a professional studio and worked diligently with our team to drive the design and development of features they felt would help elevate their app when compared to others.

Due to a lack of funding, I streamlined the research phase by collecting assumptions from stakeholder and user interviews and compared them against the competitive landscape. In doing so, we were able to find holes in the market that would help make the Grace Hypnosis app more personal, resulting in an experience that users would prefer. This research yielded the design and development of the custom recording discovery feature that not only created a more unique and personal experience for users but also increased the app’s revenue stream due to encouraging users to subscribe to paid premium content.

After stakeholder interviews, I wrote a few user personas and created a journey map. I leveraged these to design a low-fidelity version of the mobile app while simultaneously started defining a design system and branding strategy. Once the feature experiences and branding strategy were approved, I designed a high-fidelity version of the app. I worked directly with developers during the app’s development.

The new Grace Hypnosis mobile app has been on the app store for less than a year and has already received 272 ratings with an average rating of 4.8 stars.",https://studiosewell.com/work/grace-hypnosis/,4cmMqYbW

I also worked alongside another Senior User Experience Designer and a Design System Manager in an effort to update the entire Abercrombie mobile app design system including all of the foundational design elements, components, and patterns in Sketch.

What is PostgreSQL? PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system. Object-relational databases use a hybrid approach to databases.

In object databases, information is stored as objects, much like object-oriented programming. In relational databases, information is stored in tables with relationships between tables defined by primary and foreign keys. Importantly, PostgreSQL allows the use of advanced functions (such as Window Functions), and even development and use of custom functions written in different programming languages. Here is a link to better understand what is meant by an object-relational database, and how it differs from a relational database. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_database

Ready to proceed with PostgreSQL? Follow along!

Step 1. Downloading PostgreSQL First, you will need to install PostgreSQL on your local machine. Select the following three components during installation - PostgreSQL server, pgAdmin, and command-line tools. pgAdmin is a GUI tool for managing the database. Download the installer from the link below, and install with the admin privileges:

Installing PostgreSQL for Windows: https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/ and follow the steps mentioned here

#Overview:
Amazon's global sales in 2021 were $468.78 billion. That is $64.34 billion more sales than in 2020, a 15.91% increase. Amazon's net income for the 12-month period ending on September 30, 2021, was $26.263 billion, a 51.14% year-over-year increase. Most of these sales come from the roughly 2 million active third-party sellers. While the marketplace offers great potential, there’s a lot involved in choosing the right product to sell on Amazon. You need to find an item with a good amount of demand, a low level of competition, and solid profit margins. In addition to all of these things, your product should also sell consistently all year long.

#Overview
The google play store is one of the largest and the most popular android app stores. It has an enormous amount of data that can be used to make the various prediction and Analytical models. This dataset consists of 13 different features which has been used for data analytics.

#Introduction:
Mobile application are one of the fastest growing segments of downloadable software application market. Out of all of the markets I choose Google Play Store due to its increasing popularity and recent fast growth. One of the main reasons of its popularity is the fact that about 81% of the apps are free of cost. Developers and users play key roles in determining the impact that market interactions have on future technology. However, the lack of a clear understanding of the inner working and dynamics of popular app market, impacts both the developers and users.



#Analysis Methodology:
Our analysis approach is divided into three phases:
- Data extraction (From the provided dataset)
- Data cleansing
- Visualization
- Dashboard / Report Making


- Data Extraction: This process deals with data collection in this we gathered the dataset provided by Ineuron.

- Data Cleansing: This process deals with data manipulation, data which is collected in the previous step consist of NaN values, unwanted Columns, outliers. handling this error is also known as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

- Visualization: This step is also one of the part of EDA, Generally after data cleansing. Various observations are performed over the data in order to find some relationships amongst the (feature – feature) or (feature – labels). And during this process we use different types of chart, graph in order to make better visualizations.

## Dataset

 This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The Ford Go Bike Data can be downloaded from here: https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found some quality and tidiness issues. There were some missing values, wrong data type and some columns needed for exploration were not present in the dataset. I cleaned the quality and tidiness and start exploration. The main features include data related to the start and end of a ride. This can be used to calculate when bikes are in high or low demand. There is also ample data related to the users of the bike service including their age, gender, and whether they are a paying member or a casual user. There were more subscribers than customers and more males than females. I also found out that the system is being used mostly in the morning hours (8-9am) and afternoon hours (5-6pm). I performed countplot to show the distribution between start hour and user type, which subscribers use the system more than customers. That makes sense because subscribers are mostly working class people using the system to commute to work while customers are mostly tourists that uses the system ton tour the Bay Area.


## Key Insights for Presentation

Tweet Emotion Recognition using LSTM,"Emotions are regarded as being of the utmost importance since they play a significant role in human connection. In today's environment, social media is crucial to how individuals engage with one another. Emotional analysis of these social media posts is beneficial. Twitter is a microblogging platform where users from all over the world may post and express their emotions. Because tweets are brief and informal, sentiment analysis for Twitter communications (also known as ""tweets"") is thought to be a difficult topic. Recurrent neural networks are used to build and train a model that can identify emotions in tweets. There are thousands of tweets in the dataset, and each one is categorized into one of six emotions: love, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and rage.

Sentiment analysis, commonly referred to as opinion mining or emotion AI, is the systematic identification, extraction, quantification, and study of affective states and subjective data using natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics. Sentiment analysis is frequently used in marketing, customer service, and clinical medical applications. It is used to voice of the customer materials including reviews and survey replies, internet and social media, and healthcare materials. The practice of gathering data about a consumer's assessment of a good, service, or brand is known as sentiment analysis. Natural language processing (NLP) is used in social media sentiment analysis to analyze online mentions and ascertain the emotions that underlie the post. Using social sentiment analysis, you may determine whether a post was favorable, unfavorable, or neutral.

Classifying the polarity of a given text at the document, sentence, or feature/aspect level—whether the conveyed opinion in a document, sentence, or entity feature/aspect is positive, negative, or neutral—is a fundamental task in sentiment analysis. For example, advanced, ""beyond polarity"" sentiment classification examines emotional states including pleasure, rage, disgust, sadness, fear, and surprise.

In this project, an LSTM-based model is built and trained to identify emotions in tweets. There are thousands of tweets in the dataset, and each one is categorized into one of six emotions: love, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and rage. This multiclass classification problem of the natural language processing domain is resolved using TensorFlow as the machine learning framework.

It was important to create unusual design together with memorisable animation because the client's business is connected with entertainment. The other goal was to attract young audience so it was important to keep design modern.

I decided to start with black background and add  spotlights with purple, blue, pink colours, shades were taken from the brand colours. As an accent color I chose gold that goes good with black plus it conveys celebration mood.

Long text was not an option for such topic so we tried to make it short + I've used a lot of lists to accent the main ideas.

Platform: Low & high fidelity design in Figma, creating the website on Tilda.

Bright and soft colors were used to convey calm atmosphere to the visitors of the website, create safe and protected environment.

Features:
- Website is mostly made with Zero-blocks.
- Custom menu bar was made (with HTML) in order to add all required functionality to it.
- The user can sign up for courses and make an appointment on the website. At the moment the website uses Tilda forms to capture  leads. In future we plan to connect Timepad and Yclients.

Shopify Wears Speed Optimization,"From 40s to 1.2s🤯🤯

User Experience is not complete without speed optimization......


A friend own a store and they had a website. They recently redesigned it and the design is awesome yeah.

With a lot of advertisements going around, I was opportune to check out the website but then it was so so slow. I had to approach him (my friend) and informed him about it.

Then, boom a few days later, the developer came knocking. He told me he didn't want this work to fail.

Imagine waiting for 10-20s, 20-30s and the website isn't up yet. Damn high bounce rate, low conversion rate and it reduces trust and sales generally.

You could be losing customers because of the speed of your website. A perfectly developed website is not perfect without speed.

I was also opportune to offer Basic SEO services. Check out the video...... Watch it completely, you will see it🌚😂",http://sportifywears.com/,
